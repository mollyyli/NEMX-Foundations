## Problem Statement
* Inpatient families fill out order form and receive groceries once a week; however, sometimes requested food items may not be available in stock.
* Need to hide PII/PHI data from the order forms before they get sent to the U District Food Bank

## Proposed Solution
* Create a web application where inpatient families can easily access real-time stock availability and place specific food requests with online order forms
* The submitted forms will automatically hide PII/PHI data from those preparing food bangs at the U District Food Bank
